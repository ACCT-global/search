# Suggestions

`Suggestions` is a component used in the `vtex.store.search.v2` to suggest search terms similar to the current query.

## Configuration

1. Import the Suggestions's app to your theme's dependencies in the `manifest.json`, for example:

```json
  dependencies: {
    "vtex.search": "0.x"
  }
```

2. Add the `search-suggestions` block to the `search-result-layout.desktop.enhanced` or `search-result-layout.mobile.enhanced`. For example:

```json
"search-result-layout.desktop.enhanced": {
    "children": [
        "flex-layout.row#suggestion",
    ],
    "flex-layout.row#suggestion": {
        "children": ["search-suggestions"]
    }
}
```
